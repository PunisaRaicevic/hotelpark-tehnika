Dear Developer,
We detected and will disable a publicly exposed Service Account authentication credential associated with the following Google Cloud Platform account:

firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@hgbtapp.iam.gserviceaccount.com with key ID 3da29cd068cc4223984663a9ae51e4e0c37daaf0

This key was found at the following URL: https://github.com/PunisaRaicevic/HGBROdrzavanje5/blob/a2c5e04c05256b262fd638ff64a09ee243fd69dc/attached_assets/Pasted--type-service-account-project-id-hgbtapp-private-key-id-3da29cd068cc422398466-1764065791192_1764065791193.txt

For a subset of abuse issues, we send abuse notifications in log format. Please login to your console and review this abuse notification in Cloud Logging.

To prevent potential security and abuse risks, this Service Account authentication credential will be disabled in accordance with your Organizational Policy for “Service account key exposure response”. Your Service Account Credential  may have been inadvertently published in public sources or websites (for instance, the credentials were mistakenly uploaded to a service like GitHub). Please note that as the project/account owner, you are responsible for securing your resources.  

Immediate action is required to secure your account(s). We strongly recommend that you take the following steps:

Log in to the Google Cloud Console and review the activity on your account. 
Rotate the credential for the disabled Service Account. 
Take immediate steps to ensure that your Service Account credentials are not embedded in public source code systems, stored in download directories, or unintentionally shared in other ways.
